## Overview: What Is a Framing Effect?

When two options are *mathematically the same* but *worded differently*, many people change their choice anyway—and that "wording pull" is called a **framing effect**.

In De Martino et al. (2008), the key behavioral measure was literally the difference **P(gamble | loss frame) − P(gamble | gain frame)**, i.e., how much more often someone gambles when the sure option is described as a loss rather than a keep. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23387252_Explaining_Enhanced_Logical_Consistency_during_Decision_Making_in_Autism))

Picture this with money: "**keep £20**" can feel calmer than "**lose £30**," even though both describe the same outcome from £50.

In their task, the gamble was identical across frames (same probabilities), and only the sure option's description changed ("keep" vs "lose"), so any shift in gambling rate is attributed to framing rather than different math.

## The Headline Result

The autistic group was *less* pulled around by that wording.

Quantitatively, the framing susceptibility averaged **14.24%** in controls versus **7.66%** in the ASD group (a **6.58 percentage-point** drop, about **46% smaller** relative to controls).

### Gambling Rates by Frame

| Group | Gain Frame | Loss Frame | Framing Effect |
|-------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Control | 43.75% | 57.99% | 14.24% |
| ASD | 34.52% | 42.19% | 7.66% |

The "loss wording = gamble more" pattern was still present in the ASD group, but noticeably weaker.

## The Physiology: Skin Conductance Responses

A useful curiosity hook: the study suggests it's not that autistic participants had *no emotion*—it's that the *context cue* ("keep" vs "lose") had less leverage over the decision.

They tracked **skin conductance responses (SCR)**—a standard autonomic measure often used as a proxy for emotional arousal during decisions—and found the ASD group showed **little to no differential SCR** between gain and loss frames.

In plain terms: "my choice is being driven more by the structure of the options than by the social/affective 'vibe' of the wording."

In their interpretation, that looks like reduced use of an "affect heuristic," which can increase logical consistency in this narrow lab task while potentially reducing flexibility when context is genuinely informative.

## About the "65–80% Reduced Susceptibility" Claim

The specific quote "**65–80% reduced susceptibility**" is **not** the behavioral reduction reported by the main framing-effect percentage in this paper.

* **Behaviorally:** The reported group means (7.66% vs 14.24%) correspond to roughly a **46%** reduction in framing-effect magnitude
* **Physiologically:** The **~65–80%** range makes more sense for physiology-style comparisons where the frame-related SCR difference in ASD was close to wiped out (depending on calculation method)

---

## Study Methodology (Mechanics)

### Participants

* Recruited **32** participants, analyzed **29** after exclusions
* **Exclusions:**
  * One person taking **olanzapine**
  * One who couldn't fully understand instructions
  * One statistical outlier (framing score >2 SD above mean)
* **Final groups:** 14 ASD (10 male) and 15 controls (11 male), matched on age and IQ
* ASD participants had prior clinical diagnosis (ICD-10), also completed **ADOS Module 4**

### Task Design

* Each trial: "you receive £X" message → forced choice between sure option and gamble
* **3 sessions × 17 minutes**, each with **96 trials:**
  * 32 gain-frame
  * 32 loss-frame
  * 32 catch trials (attention checks)
* Starting amounts: **£25, £50, £75, £100**
* Response by keypress within **4 seconds**
* Gamble win probabilities: **20%, 40%, 60%, 80%**
* Expected value balanced and mathematically equivalent across frames

### Catch Trials

* Made one option clearly better on expected value
* Checked attention and understanding
* No significant difference between groups on catch-trial performance
* Main analysis re-run controlling for catch-trial performance

### Statistical Analysis

* **Behavioral:** Mixed-measures ANOVA (frame as within-subject, group as between-subject)
* Checked overall risk preference as covariate—reduced framing susceptibility in ASD remained

### Physiology (SCR)

* Electrodes attached to fingers, sampled at **100 Hz**
* Window: **5 seconds after decision** (baseline taken just before task display)
* Exclusions: failed recordings, responses <2 microSiemens
* Removed nonphysiological responses (<10% of dataset)
* Z-transformed within-subject
* Analysis: **2×2×2 ANOVA** (group × frame × choice)

## Key Takeaways

### What This Evidence Shows

* In this specific lab setup, autistic adults on average showed **more frame-invariant choices** than matched controls
* The frame didn't produce the same **physiological differentiation** (gain vs loss) in the ASD group, even though they had robust absolute arousal levels

### Practical Implications

**Empowering:** "My decisions are less steerable by marketing-language tricks"

**Tricky:** "Sometimes context *is* real information, especially socially"

### Limitations

* Small sample (n=29) of adults with relatively high IQ scores
* Specific inclusion/exclusion criteria
* Treat as **strong clue—not universal law** about all autistic people

## Original Research Prompt

```
"Autistic individuals show 65-80% reduced susceptibility to framing
effects (De Martino et al., 2008)"

Please explain those results in explanation that one can say to
autistic listeners in way that both , those with more advanced and
less advanced math, scientific background get get their own insights,
by interleaving between different audience types from sentence to
sentence making overview interesting to all audience that early on
gives insights and triggers curiosity and the longer you go the more
you unfold details, nuances and finally mechanical details how study
was conducted, measured, what were exact criteria, etc.
```
