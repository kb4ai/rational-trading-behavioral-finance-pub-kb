What kind of biases take place when people rebalancing SPOT portfolio are thinking about price levels they entered and are biased by this, instead of focusing on "now" and "future" most optimal operation?

After all if on spot best at "now" according to data we have level to put sell order is e.g. 123 AAABBB then I should set it regardless of the price I entered, because I optimize for now and future and past is past, what I have now in my portfolio I use. I guess it's sunk cost fallacy, what are other biases taking play here in typical "traders" (especially retail) reasoning , emotional, cognitive? And how are they manifested in "trading" community, media, influencers, etc, how to spot those patterns, and avoid them, and stay rational, objective, autistic absolute, mathematical, in approach?

 In analysis present what we know about different cognitive types, how majority neurotype spread wrong incorrect biases in community, books, media, articles, systems? How minority neurotypes like super high IQ , absolute autistic and others can help together with mathematics, symbolic systems (like Mathematica Computer Algebra System, etc)  or at least their way or modelling and reasoning at world, and how still such super rational actor should consider other traders potential biases and how institutional, algorithmic, ML/AI, traders can use them by checking e.g. when most people entered e.g. on liquidity heatmaps, trading volume measurements at different price levels and utilize this information to exploit other trading actors cognitive biases flaws and consider in their autistic absolute, mathematical logical correctness, that considers other actors potential cognitive and emotional biases in their modelling , analysis and reasoning, utilize.
