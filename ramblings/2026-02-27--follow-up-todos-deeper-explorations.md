## Original Prompt (verbatim)

> TODOs:
>
> * please calture my exact prompt and your exact response now with exact formatting under ramblings/
>
> * I would love to get more parallels to Thaler and other works especially on cognitive models,
>
> * and especially parallels to other phenomenon, like people splitting aritficially life into "work vs leasure" and here we can relate to speeches and thoughts of Alan Watts, basically covering in lenghts how it makes non sense and creates a lot of psychological fractioning ... probalby Krishnamourti also covered this => make additional ramblings/ document on this with all findings and relations to topics
>
> * "you're describing the entire concept of
>   "spending" as ontologically wrong — a category error, not just a bias." => yes please make additional ramblings document on this with all potential other rellations to semantics ontology, semiotics, etc...
> "The literature treats it as a deviation from rationality; you treat it as a failure of language itself." => YES! Beause a lot of people think in language and are blinded of it's limltations. However those that think in abstract mental pictures (like me) and use language only as ways to communicate describe what they see/feel it helps to see multi dimensionally beyond words, that 's why also necessity to emphasis importance of neurocognitivistic exploration of minority neurotypes and appreciation, and philosophical and cognitive modelling and reasoning to be dedicated
>
> * "Super turbo rational mathematical entity" — The framing of the correct
>   perspective as a mathematical entity's view (not a "debiased human" view) is
>   philosophically distinct. The literature says "humans are biased, here's how to
>    fix it." Your frame: "the mathematical description is the ground truth; the
>   human experience is the distortion." This is closer to a Platonic/formalist
>   position than the behavioral economics norm.
> => Yes, additional rambligns/ document also adding how Kensyans economists are not only economists, that there is also Austrian Economism and many other, and also alternative economics models and dig idffer on Platonic/formalist positions and how they related.
>
> * Finally connect findings and realisations thoughts form thos ramblins documents into main documents in other sections and ofc when relatable add as reference
>
> * And make this prompt also a ramblings document on its own.

## Research Directions Identified

1. **Cognitive models paralleling Thaler** — dual-process theory, bounded rationality, cognitive load, attention economics
2. **Artificial life partitioning (work/leisure)** — Alan Watts, Krishnamurti, psychological wholeness vs. fragmentation
3. **"Spending" as ontological/linguistic error** — semiotics, Sapir-Whorf, Wittgenstein, category theory, visual thinking vs. linguistic thinking, neurodivergent cognition
4. **Platonic/formalist economics** — Austrian School, heterodox economics, mathematical Platonism vs. behavioral empiricism
5. **Integration** — connect ramblings insights back into core-research documents
