# Platonic/Formalist Economics: The Ground Truth Question

> **Is the mathematical model the truth that humans deviate from, or is human behavior the truth that models approximate?**

## Motivation

The standard behavioral economics framing: "Humans are biased. Here's how to fix them."

Our framing: "The mathematical description is the ground truth. Human experience is the distortion."

This is a philosophically distinct position — closer to mathematical Platonism than to the behavioral empiricism of Kahneman-Thaler. But it's not the only alternative to Keynesianism. This document maps the full landscape of economic philosophies and their relationship to the "spending as asset transformation" thesis developed in [fungibility-asset-transformation-rational-framework.md](../core-research/fungibility-asset-transformation-rational-framework.md).

## 1. The Debreu-Bourbaki Program: Economics as Pure Mathematics

Gerard Debreu (1921-2004, UC Berkeley) absorbed the axiomatic program of the French mathematical collective **N. Bourbaki**. His *Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium* (1959, Cowles Foundation) attempted to do for economics what Bourbaki did for analysis: derive everything from minimal axioms with maximal rigor.

Debreu's Nobel lecture (1983): "Debreu's mathematical model of the economy is no longer an *analogy*; it **captures its essence**." This is not instrumentalism — it is a direct Platonic claim. The model doesn't *approximate* reality; it *is* the deep structure of reality.

The Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium (1954) posits:

* L commodities indexed by physical characteristics, location, date, and state of the world
* Agents with complete preference orderings satisfying convexity and continuity
* A price vector p ∈ ℝ^L clearing all markets simultaneously

The **rational agent** here is not a psychological description but a **mathematical object**: a preference relation satisfying completeness, transitivity, and continuity. Behavior violating these axioms is simply outside the model's domain.

### Connection to our framework

Our "super turbo rational mathematical entity" IS the Arrow-Debreu agent. When we say "each entity owns assets and that's it" — we are describing the Debreu world where an agent is characterized entirely by its endowment vector and preference ordering. No mental labels, no accounts, no "savings vs. spending" — just a point in commodity space and a direction of optimization.

### Internal critique: Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem (1972-1976)

Even if all individual agents satisfy Arrow-Debreu rationality, aggregate excess demand functions can be *arbitrary* continuous functions — rationality constraints impose almost no testable restrictions on observable market behavior. The Platonic ideal self-undermines at the aggregate level.

## 2. Austrian School: Rationality as Tautology

### Key thinkers

Carl Menger (1840-1921), Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973), Friedrich Hayek (1899-1992), Murray Rothbard (1926-1995)

### Praxeology: Economics from a single axiom

Von Mises (*Human Action*, 1949) derives all economics deductively from one synthetic a priori proposition: **"Human action is purposeful behavior."** This is praxeology — economics as logical system, not empirical science.

The radical implication: **all human action is rational by definition**, because it reflects the agent's subjective preferences at the moment of action. Behavioral economists who find "irrationality" are imposing *their* model of what agents *should* prefer rather than observing what agents *do* prefer.

Austrian critique of mental accounting research: comparing behavior to a formal model and calling deviations "irrational" commits a category error. If an agent labels money as "savings" and treats it differently, that IS their preference — calling it "bias" assumes the researcher's utility function is normatively correct.

### Hayek's knowledge problem

Hayek ("The Use of Knowledge in Society," *AER* 1945) argued that economically relevant knowledge is:

* **Dispersed** across millions of individuals
* **Tacit** (Polanyi's sense) — not articulable propositionally
* **Context-specific** and time-specific

Arrow-Debreu's assumption of complete markets (including all future states) is not merely an idealization but a logical impossibility — the knowledge required to specify those contingent commodities doesn't exist in any agent's mind.

### Where Austrians align with our framework

The Austrian emphasis on **subjective value** and **individual purpose** is compatible with our "entity owns assets" view. Both reject aggregate models that override individual choice. But Austrians would push back on calling mental accounting "irrational" — they'd say it's the agent's revealed preference, period.

### Where they diverge

We claim there IS an objective mathematical ground truth (fungibility) that agents deviate from. Austrians claim there is no ground truth outside the agent's own preferences. This is a genuine philosophical tension.

## 3. Keynesian and Post-Keynesian: Irrationality as Feature, Not Bug

### Keynes: Animal spirits

Keynes (*The General Theory*, 1936, Chapter 12) introduced "animal spirits" — the psychological propensity to action under fundamental uncertainty. Crucially, animal spirits are "neither rational nor irrational" — they are a *necessary* response to situations where rational calculation is impossible because the future is genuinely open.

### Post-Keynesian ontological uncertainty

Paul Davidson (New School) argues Keynesian uncertainty is **ontological non-ergodicity** — the economic system is non-ergodic, meaning past data cannot ground probabilistic predictions about the future. G.L.S. Shackle (*Uncertainty in Economics*, 1955) developed non-probabilistic decision theory.

The Post-Keynesian critique: mainstream models commit an **ergodic fallacy** — treating a non-ergodic system as ergodic for mathematical tractability.

### Friedman's "as if" instrumentalism

Milton Friedman ("Methodology of Positive Economics," 1953): the realism of assumptions is irrelevant — what matters is predictive power. Firms behave *as if* they maximize profit. This is philosophical instrumentalism, not Platonism — models are tools, not truths.

### Rational Expectations (Lucas-Sargent)

Robert Lucas (1937-2023, Chicago): agents form expectations using the *true model* of the economy. This is a stealth Platonic move — the correct model is derived from first principles, and deviations are transitory. The Lucas critique (1976) showed that Keynesian structural equations change when agents adapt expectations to policy changes.

## 4. Heterodox Perspectives

### Veblen: Categories as "habits of thought"

Thorstein Veblen (*The Theory of the Leisure Class*, 1899) argued that economic categories like "utility" and "preference" are not natural kinds but **institutionalized habits of thought** — historically contingent cognitive patterns. "Institutions" = "customary habits of thought."

This directly connects to mental accounting: "savings" and "spending money" are Veblenian habits of thought, not mathematical objects.

### Marx: Commodity fetishism as structural misperception

Marx (*Capital*, Vol. 1, Ch. 1, §4) argued that commodity fetishism is a **structurally generated misperception** — under capitalism, social relations between people necessarily appear as relations between things (prices). This is not irrationality in the behavioral sense; it's an epistemological illusion embedded in social structure itself.

Money-as-object (rather than money-as-relation) is itself a fetishized category — making "spending" (destroying an object) a natural metaphor, when the underlying reality is a transformation of social claims.

### Georgescu-Roegen: Thermodynamic foundations

*The Entropy Law and the Economic Process* (1971) argued neoclassical economics uses a **mechanistic, reversible-process model** from classical mechanics. Thermodynamics shows economic processes are irreversible — entropy increases, resources degrade. Arrow-Debreu implicitly assumes timeless, reversible equilibria; the entropy law forbids this.

This DIRECTLY supports our "spending as asset transformation" framework — Georgescu-Roegen formalized that economic processes are *transformations* governed by thermodynamic laws, not circular flows.

### Complexity economics: Emergence without equilibrium

W. Brian Arthur (Santa Fe Institute, *Complexity and the Economy*, 2014) rejects equilibrium entirely. Agents have *inductive rationality* (pattern recognition, heuristics) rather than deductive rationality. Key results: individually "rational" agents can generate collectively irrational outcomes — emergent irrationality from individual bounded rationality.

## 5. Philosophy of Mathematics Applied to Economics

### Hilbert's formalism → Debreu

Hilbert's program: axiomatize mathematics, prove consistency by finitary means. Debreu is Hilbertian in spirit. But Gödel's incompleteness theorems (1931) destroyed Hilbert's program: no consistent formal system rich enough to express arithmetic can prove its own consistency.

Applied to economics: **Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu** shows that Arrow-Debreu axioms underdetermine aggregate behavior — a Gödel-like internal incompleteness.

### Brouwer's intuitionism → constructive economics

Brouwer rejected non-constructive existence proofs. Arrow-Debreu equilibrium existence proofs use non-constructive fixed-point theorems. An intuitionist rejects these: proving equilibrium "exists" without an algorithm to find it is mathematically empty.

Velupillai's *Computable Economics* (2000): economies must be described by computable functions (Church-Turing thesis), eliminating many standard results.

### Blaug's verdict

Mark Blaug (*The Methodology of Economics*, 1980/1992): mainstream economics is a **degenerative research program** (Lakatos) — its core (utility maximization, equilibrium) is protected from falsification by auxiliary hypotheses. Economists practice "innocuous falsificationism" — going through the motions while ensuring no core hypothesis can fail.

## 6. The Six Positions on Ground Truth

| Position | Proponents | Ground truth | Our framework fit |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **A. Mathematical Platonism** | Debreu, Arrow, New Classical | Formal model is deep reality; deviations are noise | **Strong fit** — our "mathematical entity" view |
| **B. Instrumentalism** | Friedman | Models are tools, not truth-claims | Partial fit — we can use it pragmatically |
| **C. Behavioral realism** | Kahneman, Thaler | Human psychology is ground truth; models approximate | **Weak fit** — we invert their framing |
| **D. Ontological uncertainty** | Post-Keynesians, Shackle | Neither model nor psychology; reality is non-ergodic | Orthogonal — addresses different question |
| **E. Structuralist** | Marx, Veblen | Social relations are ground truth; both models and psychology are superstructure | Compatible at meta-level (categories are socially constructed) |
| **F. Constructivist/Complexity** | Arthur, SFI | Reality is co-constructed; ground truth is emergent | Compatible if entity is an agent in the emergent system |

### Our philosophical position

We hold a **modified Position A**: the mathematical description (fungibility, conservation, set-theoretic ownership) captures formal truth about what transactions ARE. But we acknowledge Position E's insight that the *labels* (savings, spending) are socially constructed — we just insist they are *formally incoherent* constructions.

This is closest to **mathematical formalism** in the Hilbert-Debreu tradition, with a dash of Georgescu-Roegen's thermodynamic realism (conservation law as physical constraint, not just mathematical axiom).

The key disagreement is with **Position C** (behavioral economics): Thaler says mental accounting is a "deviation from rationality." We say it's a deviation from *reality* — not just from a normative model, but from what transactions actually are at the level of double-entry bookkeeping, thermodynamics, and jural relations.

## 7. Connections to Repository

* The "spending = transformation" thesis in [fungibility-asset-transformation-rational-framework.md](../core-research/fungibility-asset-transformation-rational-framework.md) aligns with Debreu's Platonism (formal model as ground truth) and Georgescu-Roegen's thermodynamics (conservation + entropy)
* The linguistic analysis (spending-language as category error) connects to Veblen's "habits of thought" and Marx's "commodity fetishism" — language reifies what is actually a social relation
* The autistic advantage hypothesis connects to the Austrian-behavioral tension: Austrians would say autistic individuals are simply *more consistent* in their preferences, not "more rational" — but our formalist framework says they are closer to the mathematical ground truth
* The game-theoretic exploitation analysis shows that regardless of which philosophical position is "correct," agents who violate fungibility are exploitable — a pragmatic argument that transcends the ontological debate
