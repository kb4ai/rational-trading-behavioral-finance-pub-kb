# "Spending" as Ontological Error: Semiotics, Language, and Visual Thinking

> **The concept of "spending" is not a cognitive bias — it is a category error baked into language itself. Those who think in pictures see past it.**

## Motivation

From the [original observations](2026-02-27--original-prompt-mental-accounting-observations.md):

> "The literature treats it as a deviation from rationality; you treat it as a failure of language itself."

> "A lot of people think in language and are blinded by its limitations. However those that think in abstract mental pictures (like me) and use language only as ways to communicate/describe what they see/feel — it helps to see multi-dimensionally beyond words."

This document develops the thesis that "spending" is ontologically wrong — not merely biased but categorically incoherent — and connects it to semiotics, linguistic relativity, category theory, and neurocognitive diversity.

## 1. The Etymology Encodes the Error

Latin *expendere* = "to weigh out money, pay away" — from *ex-* (out) + *pendere* (to weigh, hang). The word physically encodes **unidirectional removal of a substance from a container**. This is the wrong metaphor for what actually happens in exchange: a bidirectional morphism between two agents, each receiving something.

The word was born in an era when money WAS a physical substance (silver, gold) being literally weighed out and physically transferred. The metaphor was approximately correct for metallic currency. For fiat currency, digital balances, and institutional claims — it is a fossil metaphor, a dead map of a territory that no longer exists.

## 2. Semiotics: Money Resists All Sign Categories

### Peirce's taxonomy fails

Peirce's tripartite sign taxonomy (icon/index/symbol):

* **Icon** (resemblance): A banknote does not resemble purchasing power
* **Index** (causal contiguity): No physical trace connects a digital balance to value
* **Symbol** (convention): Partially — but money's meaning is radically context-free

Hornborg (1999): *"Money does not fit into any of the three categories established by Peirce, as it does not refer to a specific commodity either through contiguity, similarity, or convention. The essential property of all-purpose money is its capacity to adopt almost any meaning that its owner attributes to it."*

This **hyper-symbolic indeterminacy** is precisely what makes the linguistic freezing of money as "thing that gets spent" so pernicious — language imposes a fixed ontology on a sign whose defining feature is ontological fluidity.

### Saussure: Value as relational, not intrinsic

Saussure derived his sign theory partly from marginalist economics. Value is constituted by *difference* within a system, not by intrinsic properties. "Spending" collapses the relational nature of value into a unidirectional destruction narrative.

### Baudrillard: Hyperreal money

Baudrillard (1976, *Symbolic Exchange and Death*; 1981, *Simulacra and Simulation*) traces money through three orders of simulacra until electronic money becomes **pure simulation** — a sign with no referent. "Spending" in a hyperreal economy is linguistically incoherent: you cannot *destroy* something that never had material substance. Purchasing is a *rerouting of informational claims*, not annihilation.

## 3. Sapir-Whorf: Language Shapes Economic Behavior

### Chen (2013): The strongest evidence

Keith Chen found that languages with **obligatory future-tense marking** (FTR — grammatically distinguishing future from present) systematically produce worse savings behavior:

* FTR-weak speakers (Chinese, Finnish, German) save **6% more GDP/year**
* 31% more likely to have saved in any given year
* Accumulated **39% more wealth by retirement**
* Effect survives controlling for culture, religion, institutions

**Mechanism**: When language *forces* the speaker to treat future as grammatically distinct from present, it psychologically distances future-self from present-self → hyperbolic discounting amplified linguistically.

### The "spend" parallel

Chen's finding implies a directional hypothesis: languages/lexicons that frame transactions as **losses** ("spend", "cost", "outlay", "expenditure") vs. **neutral transfers** should show differential economic behavior. This is untested but predicted by the same Whorfian mechanism.

### Whorf's own insurance insight

Whorf's motivating example: workers near "empty" gasoline drums behaved carelessly because *empty* cognitively implied "null/safe" — despite explosive vapor. The word's **ontological category** directly caused behavior. The parallel: "spending" implies exhaustion/depletion, generating loss-experience even in symmetric exchanges.

## 4. Wittgenstein and Ryle: Language Games and Category Errors

### Wittgenstein: "Spending" as a language game

Wittgenstein (*Philosophical Investigations*, 1953, §§19-23): Language games constitute their own internal ontologies. "Spending" belongs to a **particular language game** (household accounting, loss-tracking) that is *not* the appropriate game for portfolio theory, opportunity cost reasoning, or time-value calculations.

Steininger (2025) in *Finance and Society* applies Wittgenstein's **hinge propositions** (*On Certainty*, §§341-343) — beliefs so foundational they cannot be doubted without dissolving the language game. "Money gets spent" functions as a hinge: it structures the grammar of financial talk while being epistemically immune to challenge within ordinary discourse.

*"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."* (*Tractatus*, 5.6) — For the verbal thinker, the "spending" frame IS the boundary of their financial world.

### Ryle: The category mistake

Ryle (*The Concept of Mind*, 1949): A category mistake is "the presentation of facts belonging to one category in the idioms appropriate to another." The tourist asking "Where is the University?" while standing among Oxford's constituent colleges.

**"Spending" is the same logical error**: Money (a **claim-structure** on productive capacity, a relational position in a network of obligations) is treated as a **material substance** that undergoes physical depletion. You cannot *exhaust* an institutional fact any more than you can *weigh* a promise.

### Searle: Institutional facts

Searle (*The Construction of Social Reality*, 1995): Money is an institutional fact — "X counts as Y in context C." Its entire existence is relational. The word "spending" imports material-object grammar (consumption, depletion) into a domain where such grammar is categorically inapplicable.

## 5. Category Theory: The Mathematically Correct Language

### Transactions as morphisms

In category theory, a **morphism** f: A → B is a structure-preserving map. A purchase transaction is naturally modeled as a **morphism** in the category of resource allocations:

```
purchase: (Agent_A has [money M], Agent_B has [good G])
        → (Agent_A has [good G], Agent_B has [money M])
```

This is an **isomorphism** (invertible morphism) in a symmetric monoidal category — total structure is *preserved*, merely *rearranged*. "Spending" erases the isomorphism by treating only one component (A's loss of M) as the event.

### Resource theories

Fong & Spivak (2019) develop resource theories as **monoidal preorders**: objects = resource states, morphisms = feasible transformations. Economic exchange is a bidirectional morphism pair — not unidirectional destruction. "Spending" implicitly **truncates** the morphism to its projection onto one participant.

### The ontologically correct frame

Let **Mon** be the category where objects are economic agents and morphisms are value-transfer events. Let **Goods** be the category of physical/service resources. The **product category** Mon × Goods has an exchange event as a single composite morphism — no destruction, only composition. "Spending" is the mistake of projecting this 2-dimensional morphism onto only the Mon component.

## 6. Visual Thinking vs. Linguistic Thinking

### Einstein-Hadamard: Thinking beyond words

Einstein's letter to Hadamard (in *The Mathematician's Mind*, 1945):

> *"The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and combined."*

A visual thinker modeling a transaction sees: **two agents, two objects, four arrows, a complete symmetric exchange**. No arrow disappears. The verbal thinker "spending" money sees: one direction, one object vanishing.

### Dual coding theory (Paivio)

Paivio (1991): Two independent representational systems — **verbal** (logogens) and **imagistic** (imagens). Abstract concepts including money are predominantly represented in the verbal system only — meaning they inherit language's structural constraints, including loss-framing. A mathematical/diagrammatic representation of exchange as isomorphism constitutes an **imagistic encoding** that bypasses the verbal loss frame.

### Grandin's visual taxonomy

Temple Grandin (*Visual Thinking*, 2022) identifies three cognitive subtypes:

1. **Object visualizers** — photorealistic images, concrete physical transformations
2. **Spatial/pattern thinkers** — mathematical, relational structures
3. **Verbal thinkers** — think in words, images only when forced

**Type 2 (pattern thinkers) naturally represent exchange as relational transformation** — graph-theoretic or category-theoretic structure — rather than verbal narrative of loss. This constitutes structural immunity to the "spending" category error.

### The neurodivergent advantage

Rozenkrantz, D'Mello & Gabrieli (2021) — meta-review showing autistic individuals exhibit reduced susceptibility to framing effects, representativeness heuristic, and intuition-driven overrides. The mechanisms (reduced social influence, preference for rule-based over prototype-matching cognition, reduced amygdala-driven emotional valuation) are **precisely the mechanisms by which verbal framing effects propagate in neurotypical cognition**.

The ASD cognitive phenotype = partial natural experiment in what economic reasoning looks like when linguistic framing has reduced affective purchase.

## 7. Bourdieu: Why the Error Persists

Bourdieu (1977): Language itself functions as capital within a linguistic market. The vocabulary of economic loss ("spend", "cost", "outlay") constitutes the **legitimate language** of financial discourse — the dominant code. Departing from it (modeling transactions as morphisms, reframing "spending" as "redirecting") requires *linguistic capital* (mathematical fluency, philosophical sophistication) distributed unequally.

The category error persists because those with the intellectual resources to see through it also possess the linguistic capital to operate fluently within the dominant frame — reducing the pressure to reform it.

## 8. The Error's Stratification

```
Level 1 [Etymology]:    expendere → physical depletion of substance
Level 2 [Semiotic]:     money forced into loss-of-signifier frame
Level 3 [Ontological]:  category error — material predicates on institutional entity
Level 4 [Cognitive]:    verbal framing activates loss-aversion (λ ≈ 2.25)
Level 5 [Linguistic]:   FTR-marking + "spend" vocabulary → measurable savings impact
```

The **corrective ontology** is category-theoretic: transactions are morphisms in a symmetric monoidal category of resource states. No object is destroyed; total structure is conserved under composition. This frame is natural to mathematical/visual cognitive styles and to ASD cognitive profiles, but requires deliberate construction for verbally-dominant neurotypical cognition.

## 9. Implications for This Knowledge Base

* The [fungibility-asset-transformation-rational-framework.md](../core-research/fungibility-asset-transformation-rational-framework.md) develops the mathematical proof; this document provides the philosophical foundation for WHY the proof works — it's correcting a linguistic category error, not just a cognitive bias
* The "linguistic markers" section in the rational framework should be understood as **detecting category errors in real-time discourse**, not just "spotting bias"
* The autistic advantage hypothesis is strengthened: visual/pattern thinkers are structurally insulated from the error because they bypass the verbal representation where the error lives
* Future work: cross-linguistic study of "spending" vocabulary and its correlation with mental accounting severity
